Any natural persons accessing or using your Content are deemed your “End Users.” You agree that navi does not have a direct relationship with any of your End Users and navi is not responsible for how you process or otherwise handle any End User information. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for (1) providing any required notices and (2) obtaining all End User consents required under applicable data protection and marketing laws.
          Applicable laws: You may have additional obligations under local law other than those described in these Terms, particularly if you or your End Users are located outside of the United States. Such obligations may be more restrictive than these Terms. Use of the Service does not ensure compliance with such laws, nor is navi responsible for your compliance with such laws.
          Security safeguards: You will use all reasonable efforts to protect information collected from End Users via your use of the Service, including any personal information obtained from unauthorized access or use of your Account. You are solely responsible for configuring and implementing security controls to properly manage and secure your website cookies, website headers, DNS configurations, and subdomains, as well as all similarly related web attributes. In the event you discover that any End User information collected by you has been breached, compromised, or inadvertently exposed to non-authorized third parties, you shall notify navi promptly of such a breach or exposure including the root cause, remediation steps, and compensating controls to ensure such a breach does not occur in the future.
          Security notification: You are responsible for providing any applicable notices to your End Users, third parties, or authorities under any applicable data breach notification statutes and related laws. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for any losses, personal injury, or property damage to End Users arising from or relating to your use of the Service.
          Privacy: As set forth above, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for providing any required notices and obtaining all required consents from End Users in connection with your use of the Service. Your notice and consent must be compliant with all applicable data protection and security laws and regulations. Without limiting the foregoing, before collecting or using any End User information, you must provide adequate notice of the End User information you collect, how it will be used and/or shared, and obtain any necessary consents required under the applicable data protection laws and regulations. You agree to comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations (including those applying to personal information) in connection with your access and use of the Services. You will respond to any End Users wishing to exercise their privacy rights, under the applicable law, as it relates to any information collected via your use of the Services. For example, if End Users located in certain jurisdictions may exercise a “right to be forgotten” (or “erasure”) to the information you have collected about them, you shall comply with their request as required by applicable law. For clarity, you (or, the “data controller”) are directly responsible for the End User information you instruct navi to process when you use the Service, including any information you instruct a third-party application (made available via the Service), to process. navi is not a data controller of End User information and is not responsible for responding to End Users on your behalf. To the extent navi receives a request from an End User or authority about your use of the Service, navi will notify you in compliance with or as permitted by law. To the extent that navi processes the personal information of your End Users, navi does so as a “data processor” or “service provider” under applicable data protection law. If applicable, navi shall process your End Users’ personal information in accordance with our Data Processing Addendum, which is hereby incorporated by reference.
          Notice: You agree to provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your use of the Service that: (i) complies with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, (ii) is conspicuously displayed to all End Users, and (iii) clearly and accurately describes to End Users what information you collect (such as login information, contact form data, cookies, etc.) and how you use and share such information (including for marketing and advertising) with navi and other third parties.`
